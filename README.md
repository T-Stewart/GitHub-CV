# GitHub-CV

I am a self-taught Junior Developer looking to get into the world of technology, with a key interest in web development. I am looking to learn as much as possible in both front-end and back-end domains. Although just at the start of my learning, I'm picking up skills quickly and eager to experience more. It's thoroughly exciting to be joining an industry with endless possibilities and boundless opportunities to be creative.

# Skills

## Implementing Client and Employer Briefs

My previous experience has meant that much of my professional life has been spent listening to, understanding, and then implementing other peopleâ€™s visions.

- In the role of **Sound Editor for Boom Post**, I was responsible for creating and designing sound FX for high budget TV Shows, including The Crown and Call the Midwife, each with unique criteria which needed to be realised to the highest standard.

## Dedication and Persistence

- In the film industry, you must first start as a Runner - right at the bottom of the ladder. Your main responsibilities are client and studio care. The hours are long and usually relentless. During this period, I spent my spare time practising sound editing on short films and requesting senior sound editors to let me help out on their projects. This drive and determination allowed me to become part of the sound team full time in less than a year, working on projects such as The Crown, Peaky Blinders and Chernobyl.

There is a huge satisfaction, after struggling to understand a new skill or technique, in finally getting it right.

- When I first started [Guano](https://github.com/T-Stewart/Guano) many a long day was spent trying and failing to get the application to work as I wanted it. But after all the frustration of not understanding where I was going wrong, when I did eventually get everything to work as I wanted it to, that wave of relief, joy and satisfaction is a feeling worth chasing every day.
